  "event_details": "\n\nEvent Schema Definition\n\nBelow are the detailed definitions for each event type.\n\n1. High-Level Composite Events\n\nThese events aggregate data from multiple sub-events to provide a holistic view of the cycle.\n\nEvent Name: CycleDataEvent\n\nDescription: A comprehensive, top-level event that encapsulates the complete operational snapshot of one full plunger lift cycle. It serves as a container for all granular data and sub-events, enabling a unified analysis of the cycle's dynamics and efficiency.\n\nEvent Type: Composite Container\n\nConstituent Events:\n\nBasicPressureEvent\n\nCycleDurationEvent\n\nGasVolumeProduced\n\nPlungerArrivalVelocityEvent\n\nEvent Name: CycleAnomalyEvent\n\nDescription: A high-level alert event triggered when any critical failure, inefficiency, or safety violation occurs during a cycle. It acts as a wrapper, signaling that a cycle has deviated from expected operational behavior and requires review or intervention.\n\nEvent Type: Composite Anomaly\n\nConstituent Events (Triggers):\n\nPlungerNonArrival\n\nPlungerUnsafeVelocity\n\nUnexpectedLowCasingPressure\n\nUnexpectedLowFlow\n\nUnexpectedLowCycleDuration\n\nUnexpectedHighCycleDuration\n\n2. Core Operational Metric Events\n\nThese events capture the fundamental performance metrics of the cycle.\n\nEvent Name: BasicPressureEvent\n\nDescription: Captures the key pressure changes that drive the plunger lift cycle. It is essential for evaluating lift readiness, pressure buildup, and the overall hydraulic behavior of the well.\n\nEvent Type: Core Metric\n\nVariables:\n\nVariable: delta_Pt\n\nCalculation: Pt_final - Pt_init\n\nDescription: The net change in tubing pressure during the cycle.\n\nUnits: psi\n\nVariable: delta_Cp\n\nCalculation: Cp_final - Cp_init\n\nDescription: The net change in casing pressure, which provides the lifting energy.\n\nUnits: psi\n\nVariable: delta_Pl\n\nCalculation: Pl_final - Pl_init\n\nDescription: The net change in sales line pressure.\n\nUnits: psi\n\nVariable: ph\n\nCalculation: 0.433 * SG * hl\n\nDescription: The hydrostatic pressure exerted by the liquid column (hl) in the tubing, based on its specific gravity (SG).\n\nUnits: psi\n\nEvent Name: CycleDurationEvent\n\nDescription: Defines the key time durations of a complete plunger cycle. These segments are crucial for assessing shut-in strategy, lift frequency, and operational efficiency.\n\nEvent Type: Core Metric\n\nVariables:\n\nVariable: total_cycle_duration\n\nCalculation: end_time - start_time\n\nDescription: The total duration of one complete cycle from start to finish.\n\nUnits: seconds\n\nVariable: flow_duration\n\nCalculation: Time when flow rate > 0 (calculated as timestamp of last non-zero flow minus timestamp of first non-zero flow).\n\nDescription: The total time the well was open and producing gas.\n\nUnits: seconds\n\nVariable: shutin_duration\n\nCalculation: Time when flow rate = 0 (calculated as timestamp of last zero flow minus timestamp of first zero flow).\n\nDescription: The total time the well was closed to build pressure.\n\nUnits: seconds\n\nEvent Name: GasVolumeProduced\n\nDescription: Calculates the total gas volume produced during a single cycle. This is a primary indicator of the cycle's productivity.\n\nEvent Type: Core Metric\n\nVariables:\n\nVariable: gas_volume\n\nCalculation: flow_rate * flow_duration\n\nDescription: The total volume of gas extracted during the cycle's flow period.\n\nUnits: cubic meter\n\n3. Plunger Status and Safety Events\n\nThese events track the plunger's physical behavior and related safety conditions.\n\nEvent Name: PlungerArrivalVelocityEvent\n\nDescription: Measures the velocity at which the plunger arrives at the wellhead. It is a critical metric for both performance and safety, reflecting the dynamic energy of the lift.\n\nEvent Type: Status & Safety Metric\n\nVariables:\n\nVariable: arrival_speed\n\nDescription: The measured velocity of the plunger upon arrival at the surface.\n\nUnits: m/s\n\nEvent Name: PlungerArrivalStatus\n\nDescription: Determines whether the plunger successfully arrived at the surface and provides diagnostic context for failures.\n\nEvent Type: Status\n\nVariables:\n\nVariable: non_arrival\n\nDescription: A boolean flag where true indicates the plunger did not make it to the surface, and false indicates a successful arrival.\n\nUnits: boolean\n\nVariable: UnexpectedLowCasingPressure\n\nDescription: A diagnostic boolean flag indicating if a non-arrival was accompanied by insufficient casing pressure.\n\nUnits: boolean\n\nEvent Name: PlungerUnsafeVelocity\n\nDescription: A safety event triggered when the plunger's arrival velocity exceeds a predefined safety threshold, indicating potentially damaging impact forces or aggressive flow conditions.\n\nEvent Type: Safety Anomaly\n\nTrigger Condition: arrival_speed > predefined_safety_threshold\n\nSource Variable: PlungerArrivalVelocityEvent.arrival_speed\n\n4. Specific Anomaly Events\n\nThese events are triggered when specific operational metrics deviate from their expected thresholds.\n\nEvent Name: UnexpectedLowCasingPressure\n\nDescription: Identifies abnormally low pressure buildup in the casing, which can result in insufficient force to lift the plunger. This points to issues like gas depletion, leaks, or valve malfunctions.\n\nEvent Type: Performance Anomaly\n\nTrigger Condition: BasicPressureEvent.delta_Cp is significantly lower than a predefined system threshold.\n\nEvent Name: UnexpectedLowFlow\n\nDescription: Raised when the gas volume produced during a cycle is significantly lower than expected. It highlights underperformance, possible early plunger fallback, or poor liquid unloading.\n\nEvent Type: Performance Anomaly\n\nTrigger Condition: GasVolumeProduced.gas_volume is below a pre-calculated benchmark.\n\nEvent Name: UnexpectedLowCycleDuration\n\nDescription: Flags abnormally short cycles, suggesting issues like premature venting, shallow slug formation, or mistimed plunger launches. This helps identify inefficient runtimes.\n\nEvent Type: Performance Anomaly\n\nTrigger Condition: Durations from CycleDurationEvent (total, flow, or shut-in) fall below defined lower thresholds.\n\nEvent Name: UnexpectedHighCycleDuration\n\nDescription: Highlights cycles that exceed acceptable time limits. This can indicate poor liquid unloading, sluggish arrival, or excessive shut-in, signaling a need to rebalance the cycle strategy.\n\nEvent Type: Performance Anomaly\n\nTrigger Condition: Durations from CycleDurationEvent (total, flow, or shut-in) are greater than defined upper thresholds."
